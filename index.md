# Javascript - Tic-Tac-Toe (or Noughts and Crosses)

### < insert image of final game here>


In this tutorial, we will show you how to build a basic tic tac toe (or noughts and crosses if you're from the UK) game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

In this game there are two players, the player who is first to get three in row. If nobody gets three in a row then it's a draw.

We'll be using an online environment called [syncfiddle]([https://](https://syncfiddle.net/)) to build the game. We can then work with you on the code and help you fix any bugs.
