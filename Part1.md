# Part 1 - Getting started

Open your browser and goto [https://syncfiddle.net/](https://syncfiddle.net/)

Create a new room. 

Delete the code that is already in the editor

Now were ready to add our own code to create our game

Add the following code to the HTML window in syncfiddle

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
 
<html>
  <head>
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"/>
    <title>Tic Tac Toe</title>
  </head>
 
  <body>
 
  </body>
</html>
```

This is our basic HTML template. You won't see anything on the screen yet but were going change that very soon.
